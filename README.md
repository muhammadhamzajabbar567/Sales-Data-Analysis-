Sales Data Analysis Dashboard By Using Python And Power BI Tool

Sales data analysis is a crucial process for sales teams to evaluate their performance and make data-driven decisions. It involves monitoring sales data to uncover insights about top-performing products or services, underperforming ones, customer behavior and retention, new sales and market opportunities, and the future outlook of the sales team.

To perform a sales analysis, you should track overarching metrics like net sales and deal size on a monthly basis, and more specific metrics like calls or emails sent on a shorter-term basis. You should also monitor seasonal changes and year-over-year (YoY) metrics.

A sales analysis report should include metrics such as sales activity volume, ratio of new leads to qualified leads, pricing structure, data on social media campaigns, current sales trends, and revenue and costs for a specific period. The report should also provide specific action steps to take based on the insights gathered.

The benefits of sales analysis include making better decisions, understanding market trends, boosting company profits, and improving customer satisfaction. By analyzing sales data, you can identify areas for improvement, optimize your sales strategy, and increase revenue
